      value: '<p>We are starting registration for the 2025 Spring NMHockey season at the Outpost Ice Arena and the MAC. Currently rostered players will be given priority through Saturday, December 7. Payments may be made now by Venmo, Mail or in-person. See below under Payment Methods for details. We especially encourage current league members to sign up early in the process for the upcoming season to guarantee their spot in the league. Please also let us know if you are not able to play next season.</p><p>We will begin signing up players on the wait list after Sunday, December 8 or as we know what openings we have available.</p><p>New players or returning players should visit the <a href="https://nmhockey.com/sign-up/new-returning-players">New or Returning Player Information</a> page and reach out via <a href="https://nmhockey.com/about-us/the-staff">email or text</a> to let me know they are interested in joining a team.</p><p class="text-align-center">We always strive to get every player on a team who interested in joining, but given we maintain a limited number of skaters and one goalie per team, it may not be possible to accommodate everyone. Any players we are not able to get on a team may sub ( <a href="https://nmhockey.com/about-us/the-rules#subs">subbing in the league</a> ) when the league starts up. Players that are subbing will be given priority when there is a mid-season opening, based on the best match of skill level for the player they are replacing. Subbing is also a great way to get ice time, determine the best division for a player and provide and opportunity for new players to get to know New Mexico’s great hockey community.</p><p>Important notes about partial payments:</p><ul><li>Although NMHockey accommodates players that need to split their league fees into two payments, at time of registration all players are committing to a full season and paying the full amount.&nbsp; As a courtesy, the league does offer prorated refunds. If a player must drop out during the season for any reason, that player is responsible for all fees until a suitable replacement player is found, and they must also let me, their captain, and Vice-Commissioner know. A “suitable replacement player” would be one that is a close match in skill level. Typically, this can take several weeks.</li><li>If paying half, the remainder will be due the week of Sunday, February 23.</li></ul><h3 class="text-align-center">Outpost Season Details</h3><p>We are planning to fill rosters for 24 teams again: 4 E Division, 4 D Division, 4 C Division, 4 B2 Division, and 4 B1 Division teams.</p><p>If space permits, players may skate in more than one division.
